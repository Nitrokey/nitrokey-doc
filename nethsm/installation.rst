Verify Sealed Hardware
----------------------

Your NetHSM hardware has been delivered in a sealed packaging.

Please follow the three step process closely to verify that it has arrived safely.

1. Check the wrapping paper for any tears, cuts, holes or broken sealing.

2. Check the unique handmade glitter seal on top of the wrapping paper.
You will receive a picture of it from us after wrapping.
Compare the received picture with the seal.
If you notice any changes, please contact us to arrange further action.

3. After verifying that the sealing of the wrapping paper is not broken, remove the wrapping paper.
Finally, check the four seals on the side of the NetHSM hardware.
