# Verify Sealed Hardware

If you ordered your NitroPad with sealed screws and in a sealed bag, it  allows you to check if the NitroPad has been tampered with during  shipping.

The bag and all screws on the bottom of the device have been sealed. For the bag and each of these screws you have received a photo by e-mail. The  orientation of the photos is such that the battery is on top. 

1. Check each screw individually to see if its individual appearance matches the  photo. It is best to use a magnifying glass or macro lens for this  purpose. The screws are numbered as follows.

2. If the bag or the screws do not match the photos sent, an  unauthorized opening of your NitroPad cannot be excluded. In this case  please contact us to arrange further action.
