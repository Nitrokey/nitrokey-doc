Verify Sealed Hardware
======================

Your NetHSM has been delivered in a sealed packaging. To verify that 
your NetSHM has arrived safely, you should check the packaging for any 
tears, cuts, holes or broken sealing. Further on, there is a unique 
handmade glitter seal on top of the packaging. Last but not least, we 
will send you a picture of it after packing. Please compare the picture 
to your packaged NetHSM. If you notice any changes, please contact us to 
arrange further action.

Here are some pictures of how we wrap up a NetHSM:
